## Problem Statement
- IN TENNIS, HITTING THE RACKET'S SWEET SPOT IS CRUCIAL FOR POWER, CONTROL, AND AVOIDING INJURIES.
- BEGINNERS OFTEN CANâ€™T TELL IF THEYâ€™VE HIT THE SWEET SPOTâ€”NO FEEDBACK, NO GUIDANCE.
- CURRENT METHODS RELY ON VISUAL OBSERVATION, WHICH IS DELAYED AND SUBJECTIVE.
- THEREâ€™S NO AFFORDABLE, REAL-TIME SOLUTION TO PROVIDE INSTANT FEEDBACK BASED ON HIT QUALITY.
- MISSED HITS ALSO CAUSE UNNECESSARY VIBRATION AND NOISE, INCREASING RISK OF WRIST STRAIN.

## Solution
- Attachment on a tennis racket that senses vibration using piezo sensors
- Detects whether shot hits sweet spot based on vibration intensity thresholds
- Sends feedback through serial monitorâ€”helps players identify accuracy zones
- Includes a gamified element to make practice more interactive
- Low cost, low noise,less vibration and easy to use
- Optimal power , efficiency , accuracy , consistency and injury free.
